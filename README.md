# RoomDeco

This project expanded my React and JavaScript knowledge. 
I faced little challenges except for using media query in React.

Two links made my life easy with this project:
1  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MYfu5YWHc): I used this like to
build the image slider. expecially the logic to display images by index number.

2: (https://stackoverflow.com/a/73478951): The answer by Francesco Orsi was the
only one that actually worked with this project. Thanks to Mr Orsi !!
